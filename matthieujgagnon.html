            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Matthieu! I’m a passionate problem-solver, tech enthusiast, and aspiring builder.
                By day, I manage digital projects and help organizations streamline their workflows; by night,
                you’ll find me gaming with friends, watching shows like <em>The Bear</em>, or cooking meals that fuel my week.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love creating order out of chaos—whether it's managing accounts and digital platforms
                or organizing a game of spike ball in the park. With experience ranging from coordinating events
                to implementing CRMs, I thrive at the intersection of creativity, tech, and people.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not working, I enjoy exploring wellness practices like yoga and weightlifting,
                though I’m still figuring out how to stay consistent with them (progress, not perfection!).
                In the future, I dream of building a home on a piece of land and finding a fulfilling career
                that aligns with my personal and financial goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Above all, I believe that life is about balancing the things that matter—whether it’s spending
                time with close friends, learning something new, or just enjoying a good cup of peppermint tea.
                Feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect!
            </p>
