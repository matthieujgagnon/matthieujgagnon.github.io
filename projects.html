                <h3>Sonia St-Michel's Website</h3>
                <p>I designed and developed a captivating website for artist <strong>Sonia St-Michel</strong> using Wix. The site showcases her diverse artistic portfolio, upcoming events, and serves as a dynamic platform for her to connect with her audience. By integrating interactive galleries and a user-friendly layout, I enhanced her online presence to effectively reflect her artistic vision.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Compliance with Law 25 at En Piste</h3>
                <p>At <strong>En Piste</strong>, I coordinated efforts to ensure our organization complies with <strong>Law 25</strong>, focusing on the protection of personal information. My initiatives included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Implementing a Cookie Banner</strong>: Developed and deployed a cookie banner to inform users about data collection and obtain their consent, enhancing transparency and trust.</li>
                    <li><strong>Establishing an Incident Reporting and Tracking System</strong>: Set up a form to report and track privacy incidents, ensuring prompt responses to any issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Designating a Privacy Officer Contact</strong>: Created a dedicated email address for the <strong>Responsable de la protection des renseignements priv√©s</strong> (Privacy Officer), streamlining communication about privacy concerns.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These measures reinforced our commitment to privacy and data protection, building trust with our members and the public.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Server Migration, Archiving Procedure, and SharePoint Integration at En Piste</h3>
                <p>I led the transition from a local server to a cloud-based environment at <strong>En Piste</strong>. I also established a comprehensive <strong>archiving procedure</strong> to securely store and manage legacy data, ensuring compliance with retention policies. Additionally, I implemented <strong>SharePoint</strong> to streamline workflows and improve team productivity through intranet development.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>1Password Management and Employee Training</h3>
                <p>Building on my experience training over 200 employees at Apple, I implemented and managed <strong>1Password</strong> at En Piste. This involved migrating credentials, setting up the platform, and providing training on best practices for password security. The initiative strengthened our cybersecurity by promoting the use of strong, unique passwords and secure information sharing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Centralized Account Administration</h3>
                <p>As part of my coordination duties, I centralized account management using <strong>Google Admin</strong> and <strong>Adobe Admin</strong> tools. This consolidation enhanced security, simplified onboarding and offboarding processes, and optimized the management of software licenses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Microsoft Platforms and Event Management</h3>
                <p>Incorporating my event management experience with OFF-CINARS, I optimized various Microsoft platforms to enhance organizational efficiency:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SharePoint Development</strong>: Built and maintained a SharePoint site to centralize resources and facilitate communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Microsoft Teams Administration</strong>: Organized channels to improve project collaboration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outlook Calendar Coordination</strong>: Set up shared calendars to synchronize events and meetings.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These tools and workflows fostered a connected and efficient work environment, similar to the logistical planning I handled for large-scale events in previous roles.</p>
